# V2 Warning: This is a work in progress. Please use the V1 version for now.

Wire UI is a library of components and resources to empower your Laravel and Livewire application development.

Starting a new project with Livewire can be time-consuming when you have to create all the components from scratch. Wire UI helps to skip this step and get you straight to the development phase.


ðŸ”¥ You get with Wire UI:

- Form and UI components
- Notifications
- Confirmation notifications
- Card, modals, avatar, buttons, badges, dropdowns, and more
- All Heroicons
- All Phosphor icons

ðŸŒ± WireUI is in active development. Track all changes in the project [Changelog].
